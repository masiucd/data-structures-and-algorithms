## Data Structures <a name = "ds"></a>

So what is actually a data structure?
When you are working with data could be reading form and database, manipulating data,
then you will work with different data structures. Everything from `strings`,`graphs`,`arrays`,`linked-lists`,`trees` and much more...

Data structure is just a way of gather and organize a collection of data.

```
  1-->2-->-->3-->4

        99
  22 <-   -> 101

  ["a", "b", "c"]
```

## Complexity Analysis

#### 3 key terms:

- Complexity-Analysis = the process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis involves finding both the time complexity and space complexity of an algorithm.
  Complexity analysis is effectively used to determining how `good` and algorithm is and whether it is `better` then another one.

- Time complexity = measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept of the field algorithm and in coding interviews.

- Space complexity = A measure of how much memory an algorithm take sup, space complexity is a central concept of the field algorithm.

## Memory Analysis <a name = "memory"></a>

To really grab a better understanding of how complexity analysis and **data structures** works,
we need to know what is memory how does it work and effect our daily job as a soft-ware engineer.

#### Key terms

- **Bit**
- **Byte**
- **Fixed-Width Integer**
- **Memory**
